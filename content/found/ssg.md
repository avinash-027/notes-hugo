## Static Site Generators

**Static site generators (SSGs)** are tools that convert plain text files (like Markdown, reStructuredText, or HTML) into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. These static files are pre-built at "build time" rather than generated on-demand during "request time," resulting in faster load times, improved security, and easier deployment via CDNs.
