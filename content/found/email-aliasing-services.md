title: email aliasing services
description: Email aliasing services are privacy tools that let you create unique, temporary or permanent email addresses (aliases) that forward messages to your real inbox without revealing your primary email address.

Third-party tools provide advanced email aliasing services that forward messages from unlimited or numerous aliases to your main email address, enhancing privacy and spam control beyond built-in provider tricks like Gmail's + addressing.
